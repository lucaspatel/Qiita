"""Amplicon constants shared across components.

The amplicon workflow's `amplicon_load` job (compute orchestrator) stages the
DuckLake tables under these names; the control plane reads the staged membership
back to mint the run's public identifiers, and reads the registered tables to
serve a feature table. Neither side can see the other's code, so the names live
here.
